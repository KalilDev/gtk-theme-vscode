# GTK Theme VSCode

Checks the current GTK theme and alters the vscode theme to match it's
brightness.

For example, if the current gtk theme is adwaita-dark, the current vscode theme
will be changed to the one set in `gtk-theme.dark`.

When the gtk theme gets changed, the vscode one is also updated, automatically.
